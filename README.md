# 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe

Noughts and crosses in three dimensions!

Still to come:
- Selecting how many spaces are in a row on the board
- Possibly selecting the amount of dimensions? Although this will be hard to display once it exceeds 3
- Animations through something like Pygame?


At the moment: 1 = O, 2 = X
input you move in the format: y,z,x


             z=0        z=1         z=2
             x  x  x
        y [[[0, 0, 0], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]],

        y [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
        
        y [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]]
