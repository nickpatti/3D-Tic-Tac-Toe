# 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe

Noughts and crosses in three dimensions!

I created this project in Python as a way to help me learn other languages faster. It doesn't require any imports so it just tests the fundamentals of functions and loops.

The next step with this project would be to allow the user to enter how many dimensions they would want to play the game in. This would evenutally get too complex for a person to keep up with however, so it might be interesting to involve machine learning, possibly tensorflow.

Still to come:
- Selecting the length of the game
- Possibly selecting the amount of dimensions? Although this will be hard to display once it exceeds 3
- Animations through something like Pygame?
- Tensorflow

At the moment: 1 = O, 2 = X
input you move in the format: y,z,x


             z=0        z=1         z=2
             x  x  x
        y [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],

        y [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
        
        y [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
